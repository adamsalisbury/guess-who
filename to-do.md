# Guess Who? — Feature Backlog

Items are listed in priority order. Pick the top item each iteration.

---

## 1. Suggested questions UI ← NEXT
A collapsible panel or inline chip list of attribute-based yes/no questions ("Does your person wear
glasses?", "Does your person have blonde hair?", etc.) that, when clicked, populate the chat input.
Speeds up gameplay and helps new players.

## 2. Face card visual polish
Iterate on face card rendering for more character and distinctiveness — more expressive facial
features, colour fills, accessory details. Still SVG/CSS only.

## 3. Challenge mode
Each player picks two Mystery People. Questions may have "Both"/"Either" answers. Modified win
condition: correctly identify both of the opponent's Mystery People.
